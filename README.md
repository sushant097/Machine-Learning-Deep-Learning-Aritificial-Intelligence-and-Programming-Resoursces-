# Resources Links and Description
### [Understanding LSTM Networks](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) By [Christopher Olah](http://colah.github.io/about.html)
- Better Understand and Visualization of the Basic LSTM Neural Network.

### [Understanding LSTM and its diagrams](https://medium.com/mlreview/understanding-lstm-and-its-diagrams-37e2f46f1714) By Shi Yan
- Expanded detailed of LSTM network with LSTM diagram Visualization
- Can able to download **Shi Yan** LSTM  diagram [here](https://github.com/shi-yan/FreeWill/blob/master/Docs/Diagrams/lstm_diagram.pptx)

### [Creative Applications of Deep Learning with TensorFlow](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/creative-applications-of-deep-learning-with-tensorflow/info)    [via Kadenze](https://www.kadenze.com/courses)
- Cover the basic components of deep learning, what it means, how it works, and develop code necessary to build various algorithms such as deep convolutional networks, variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and recurrent neural networks. 
- A major focus of this course will be to not only understand how to build the necessary components of these algorithms, but also how to apply them for exploring creative applications. Free and paid options are available.
